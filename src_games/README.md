# A set of Arduboy applications for the class project.

Some of these have worked without modification, but many of these have subtle
differences from their original versions.

## Building Games

Games are built from the project root using `make`:

```bash
# Build a specific game (uses src_games/<name>/ as src_dir)
make build-game GAME=OSDemo
make build-game GAME=HelloNOISE
```

The default `make build` target builds the bootloader (`src/`).

You can also manually edit `platformio.ini` and set `src_dir`:

```ini
[platformio]
src_dir = src_games/HelloNOISE
```

Remove or comment out the `src_dir` line to go back to using the default
`src/` directory for the bootloader.

## OS Libraries

The project provides a set of OS libraries under `lib/` that games can use
as an alternative to the legacy Arduboy2 framework:

| Library | Header | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `phsi245_gfx` | `gfx.h` | 128×64 OLED: pixels, shapes, sprites, text |
| `phsi245_input` | `input.h` | Button polling with edge detection |
| `phsi245_led` | `led.h` | LED on/off/toggle control |
| `phsi245_timer` | `ostime.h` | Millisecond timer and delay |
| `phsi245_beep` | `beep.h` | Buzzer audio feedback |
| `phsi245_storage` | `storage.h` | FAT filesystem and SD card (v2 only) |
| `PHSI245_HAL` | `HAL.h` | Hardware abstraction: GPIO, I2C, SPI, touch keys |

See `lib/` and `NEW_VERSION.md` for API details. The reference example is
`src_games/OSDemo/OSDemo.ino`, which demonstrates graphics, SD card mounting,
and file I/O using only the OS libraries (no Arduboy2 dependency).
